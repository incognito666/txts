#Akeem Cox

- I got my undergrad degree from NCSU in Computer Engineering and now I'm getting my masters in Computer Science.
	* I really missed working with software during my undergrad but did love making amplifiers, embedded systems, and that sweet smell of solder. 
- I work full time at Cisco as a Software Engineering doing QA on Software Video Encoding. 
- I enjoy video games, weight lifting, bowling, sleeping (has been sparse lately), and watching anime and sporting events (American Football is my favorite) when I'm not doing work or grad school stuff.
- I also code in my free time in any language even if I don't know it I'll pick it up as I'm going.

# Project Proposal

We propose to implement a line coverage and fault localization tool in Python by using : 

- Our implementation of Tarantula in Python

- Nose

- Coverage.py and FigLeaf (2 techniques)

# Background

- Developers often face the problem of knowing how much code has been covered by their test cases for quality purposes
- If certain test cases fail, they need to know where exactly did the problem occur; they might have to navigate through multiple hierarchical method calls
- We will be using Nose to choose which testcases to execute and manage our test case suite
- Our system will tell the developers which lines of code have not been covered by their test cases
- Also, by using our implementation of Tarantula, they would be able to locate the most likely line which caused the test case to fail  

# Tarantula

- It is a fault localization technique
- Developed for Ruby
- Open source
- Uses SimpleCov for code coverage

# Nose

- Automated tool for discovery and execution of unit tests
- Extends unittest to make testing easier

# Two techniques

- Coverage.py and FigLeaf are two of the top ccode coverage libraries used in Python
- We will use both and compare and contrast our end systems
- Coverage.py is complex and standardized in providing more functionalities 
- Fig Leaf is faster than coverage.py but lacks in its reporting capability

The ziffness of dorkies must:

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

# In the evening

As shown here:

<img align=right src="../img/plot/plot1.png">

- z-ness has large variance [@item1; @item2].
- x is symmetric to y  [@item3, pp. 33-35]
- as predicted by theory [@item1]
- Donuts can be enjoyed any time of day


# During the week

This is how we roll

rolling ![all the dat](../img/dot/dot1.png)

# Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
- $\int e^(\lambda x) dx$
- $$\int_{a}^{b} e^(\lambda x) dx$$
