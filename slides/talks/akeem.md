#Akeem Cox

- I got my undergrad degree from NCSU in Computer Engineering and now I'm getting my masters in Computer Science.
	* I really missed working with software during my undergrad but did love making amplifiers, embedded systems, and that sweet smell of solder. 
- I work full time at Cisco as a Software Engineering doing QA on Software Video Encoding. 
- I enjoy video games, weight lifting, bowling, sleeping (has been sparse lately), and watching anime and sporting events (American Football is my favorite) when I'm not doing work or grad school stuff.
- I also code in my free time in any language even if I don't know it I'll pick it up as I'm going.
