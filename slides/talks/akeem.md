#Akeem Cox

- I got my undergrad degree from NCSU in Computer Engineering and now I'm getting my masters in Computer Science.
- I work full time at Cisco as a Software Engineering doing QA on Video Encoding. 
- I enjoy video games, weight lifting, bowling, sleeping (has been hard lately), and watching anime and sporting events when I'm not doing work or grad school stuff.
